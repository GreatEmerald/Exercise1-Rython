# Lesson 1, exercise 1

## Your task
Write a simple function ageCalculator in a file R/ageCalculator.R. The function should take a year as input, and return the age of someone born in that year. Use control flow, and provide some examples of how the function works in the file main.R. The function should behave as follows:

    > ageCalculator(1995)
    [1] 24

    > ageCalculator(2050)
    Error: You aren't born yet

    > is.leap('how old am I?')
    Error: x must be of class numeric
